There are a few important concepts you should keep in mind while writing Dart code:

 Dart is an object-oriented language and supports single inheritance.
 In Dart, everything is an object, and every object is an instance of a class. Every object inherits from the Object class. Even numbers are objects, not primitives.
 Dart is typed. You cannot return a number from a function that declares it
returns a string.
 Dart supports top-level functions and variables, often referred to as library
members.
 Dart is lexically scoped.

        Blocks of comments. It's not convention to use block comments in Dart.

        /// This is what you should use to document your classes.
